# Launchpad (Simple macOS-style App Launcher)

This project is a simple **Launchpad clone** built with **Python** and **PyQt6**, designed for macOS.  
It lists all installed applications from `/Applications`, `/System/Applications` and `~/Applications` and displays them in a fullscreen grid with their icons and names. Clicking an app launches it.
